### About

This app showcases ServiceStack's API First Development model where its pure APIs are unopinionated as to which UI or 
client are consuming them yet is able to support multiple UI rendering strategies including server HTML Rendered and 
Ajax Client forms, multiple View Engines, multiple layouts - all utilizing the same Service and declarative Fluent Validation. 
With no additional effort the same APIs are automatically available to [Mobile and Desktop Apps](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile).

From Server HTML generated server controls, flexible JS-enhanced custom HTML to client Ajax forms with built-in 
auto-binding available in either built-in jQuery plugin or dependency-free "Vanilla JS" TypeScript library that's easily 
consumed from both TypeScript or JavaScript Apps and can seamlessly integrate with high-level UI frameworks like 
[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com).

All productive development options also have access to the rich ecosystem around ServiceStack Services including 
[Add ServiceStack Reference](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference) for developing end-to-end 
Typed APIs for all popular Mobile and Desktop platforms. 
This App makes use of the [TypeScript support](https://docs.servicestack.net/typescript-add-servicestack-reference) 
to generate its Typed [dtos.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Validation/blob/master/world/wwwroot/dtos.ts) - 
benefiting TypeScript code-bases with compile-time safety and JavaScript code-bases from rich intelli-sense in IDEs 
that support TypeScript declarations.
